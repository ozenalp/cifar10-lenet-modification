# CIFAR-10 LeNet Modification

***THIS REPO IS A CLASS PROJECT.***


Welcome to the CIFAR-10 LeNet Modification repository! This project explores different hyperparameters, activaiton functions and optimizers by using a modified version of LeNet on CIFAR10 dataset as a class project.


- **LeNet Modification**: The LeNet architecture is adapted for the CIFAR-10 dataset. SÄ±nce the original LeNet was built for gray-scale images and CIFAR10 data has RGB images, we increased th input channels.

- **Experimentation**: A comprehensive exploration of different hyperparameters, optimizers, and loss criteria is conducted to identify the best configurations for the modified LeNet models.

- **Training and Evaluation**: The modified LeNet models are trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and their performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Visualizations**: *TO BE COMPLETED*


1. Explore the notebooks directory. The Train_Model.ipynb notebook allows you to experiment with different models, hyperparameters, optimizers, and criteria. The Visualization.ipynb notebook provides visualizations and analysis of the training

2. Customize and run the notebooks to train and evaluate the modified LeNet models. Feel free to adjust the configurations, experiment with new ideas, and analyze the results.

3. Refer to the results directory for saved models, evaluation metrics from the experiments. These resources can serve as references for further analysis and comparison.
