# cifar10-lenet-modification
 Repository Name: cifar10-lenet-modification  Description: This repository contains a project focused on modifying the LeNet architecture for improved performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. The project explores various modifications to the LeNet model, including hyperparameter tuning, different optimizers, and loss criteria. The goal is to enhance the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities on the CIFAR-10 dataset.  Key Features: - Modification of the LeNet architecture for the CIFAR-10 dataset - Experimentation with different hyperparameters, optimizers, and loss criteria - Training and evaluation of the modified LeNet models - Visualizations of training progress, loss graphs, and evaluation metrics - In-depth analysis of model performance and comparison of different variations  This project is implemented using Python and the PyTorch deep learning framework. The repository provides Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluating the models, along with scripts containing utility functions and the modified LeNet architecture. The results folder includes saved models, evaluation metrics, loss graphs, and other visualizations to showcase the outcomes of the experiments.  By exploring the modified LeNet models on the CIFAR-10 dataset, this project aims to demonstrate a deep understanding of model modifications, hyperparameter tuning, and experimental analysis. It serves as a valuable resource for learning about deep learning techniques, model architecture modifications, and their impact on performance.  Please refer to the README file for instructions on reproducing the experiments and exploring the project in more detail.
