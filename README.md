## FOLLOWING TEXTS ARE MAINLY A TEMPLATE

Welcome to the CIFAR-10 LeNet Modification repository! This project focuses on enhancing the performance of the LeNet architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a popular benchmark dataset for image classification. By exploring various modifications, hyperparameter tuning, and experimental analysis, this project aims to push the boundaries of the LeNet model and achieve improved accuracy and generalization.

## Key Features

- **LeNet Modification**: The LeNet architecture is adapted and fine-tuned specifically for the CIFAR-10 dataset. Modifications are made to the layers, hyperparameters, and training configurations to optimize performance.

- **Experimentation**: A comprehensive exploration of different hyperparameters, optimizers, and loss criteria is conducted to identify the best configurations for the modified LeNet models.

- **Training and Evaluation**: The modified LeNet models are trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and their performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Visualizations**: Visual representations of training progress, loss graphs, and evaluation metrics are provided to facilitate a better understanding of the model's performance and training dynamics.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CIFAR-10 LeNet Modification project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cifar10-lenet-modification.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can find the necessary packages and versions in the requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Explore the notebooks directory. The Train_Model.ipynb notebook allows you to experiment with different models, hyperparameters, optimizers, and criteria. The Visualization.ipynb notebook provides visualizations and analysis of the training

4. Customize and run the notebooks to train and evaluate the modified LeNet models. Feel free to adjust the configurations, experiment with new ideas, and analyze the results.

5. Refer to the results directory for saved models, evaluation metrics, loss graphs, and visualizations from the experiments. These resources can serve as references for further analysis and comparison.
